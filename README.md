# MagnetProject

This project uses python in Jupyter Notebooks with the Matplotlib and Numpy libraries in order to:

* simulate magnetic fields in cylinder and box magnets in order to determine the magnetic shielding properties of current-carrying wires
* create visualizations of H and B-fields in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of conductor symmetry and wire count on magnetic shielding processes

This project was done in collaboration with a classmate, Veronica Alfaro and submitted as our final project for Physics 260: Honors Electromagnetics at the University of Michigan.
